FRONTEND MENTOR CHALLENGE

This is credit card form, it was built with React and Vite, I didn't use any CSS library or framework. The project is frontend only, there is no connection with an API, it just controles if the values entered by the user match the correct format. The login of the form is isolated in a custom hook. I've tried to be as semantic as posible in the HTML, even if that caused some dificulties with the styles. I've also added aria labels for accessibility.
