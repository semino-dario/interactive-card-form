FRONTEND MENTOR CHALLENGE

This is a credit card form built with React and Vite. I didn't use any CSS library or framework. The project is frontend-only; there is no connection to an API. It simply checks whether the values entered by the user match the correct format. The form logic is isolated in a custom hook and I've used context in the App component for sharing data between the form and the card images. I tried to make the HTML as semantic as possible, even if that made styling a bit more challenging. I also added ARIA labels for accessibility.
